## ✅ Overview
This repository demonstrates a fully interactive **Power BI dashboard** analyzing Spotify streaming data. It applies multiple advanced **Power BI concepts** to explore track popularity, mood-based segmentation, and song recommendation systems.

✔️ Star Schema Data Model  
✔️ Custom DAX Measures & KPIs  
✔️ Interactive UX with Bookmarks & Navigation  
✔️ Drillthroughs, Tooltips, and Slicers  
✔️ Real-time Filtering & Mood Clustering

## 📊 Dataset Summary
- **Source**: Spotify API / Kaggle Dataset  
- **Tracks**: ~10,000+  
- **Features**: Danceability, Energy, Acousticness, Valence, Popularity, Genre, Artist

## 🧠 Power BI Concepts Applied

### 📐 Data Modeling & Calculations
- Star schema with central `Tracks` fact table linked to `Artists`, `Genres`, `Dates`
- Custom DAX measures:
  - Top N Songs by Metric
  - Dynamic Ranking by Popularity, Danceability, Energy
  - Average by Cluster
  - Mood/Valence calculation

### 🎛️ Interactivity & UX
- **Bookmarks**: Mood toggles (Chill, Energetic, Acoustic), UI simulation  
- **Page Navigation**: Button-based transitions between pages  
- **Slicers & Sync**: Global filters (genre, year), slicer syncing  
- **Drillthrough Pages**: Song-level insights with acoustic details  
- **Custom Tooltips**: Contextual popups for visuals  
- **Dynamic Titles**: DAX-driven slicer-responsive headings
